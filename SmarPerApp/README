---- SmarPer Android App ---

SmarPer prototype in Android, based on XPrivacy. This version ONLY performs
collection of contextual features (e.g., location, time, app name) and data 
obfuscation for three data types/permissions (i.e., contacts, location, and 
storage). This version DOES NOT performs automatic permission decisions based on
machine learning (work in progress). 

Tested on Android 4.4 and 6.0

Requires rooted phone (see XPrivary requirements https://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy)

Note: This is experimental code provided "as is" without any warranty of any 
kind. We have tested SmarPer to the best of our ability on several popular device
models from different manufacturers. SmarPer is based on XPrivacy, which has been 
shown to be stable software and is used by thousands of users. However, we cannot 
take any responsibility if your device malfunctions as a result of installing 
and using SmarPer. We recommend that you back up your data before testing 
SmarPer Android app.
