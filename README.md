SmarPer: Context-Aware and Automatic Runtime-Permissions for Mobile Devices

Smart Permissions ([SmarPer](https://spism.epfl.ch/smarper/)) is an advanced-permission mechanism for Android, with support for finer-grained permissions, context-awareness and multiple decision-levels. In addition, to help users manage permissions more efficiently and reduce permission fatigue, SmarPer provides (semi-) automatic decisions. In doing so, we will provide users with smarter controls for protecting their private information, with a lower overhead for users. We provide the source code for the SmarPer prototype in Android and the Machine Learning framework used in the SmarPer project.

# Structure of the code
This project is organized as follows:
- `SmarPerApp/`: SmarPer prototype in Android, based on [XPrivacy](https://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy).
- `ML/`: Machine Learning framework for carefully training and comparing different context-aware models that predict permission decisions. 

# Documentation
